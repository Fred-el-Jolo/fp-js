# Notes about https://github.com/getify/Functional-Light-JS/
Functional programming in JS

## Why [light] FP ?

### Confidence
- Trust your code
- Easier to write, read & understand with FP
- FP => fewer bugs

### Communication
- Code as a way for humans to communicate
- FP principles well established, studied & validated

### Readability
- From imperative (How to do) to declarative (What to do)
- No obscure statement to understand (if, for...)
- Flow of data is explicit

### Perspective
- FP formalism is cumbersome and can be difficult to get through

## Nature of functions

### Function vs procedure
- Function: input -> output
- Procedure: arbitrary collection of functionality
- Functions parameters: 'arity'
    - arity 1 => unary
    - arity 2 => binary
    - arity n => n-ary
